# Changelog

All notable changes to **mailproof** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Pre-library status.** mailproof has no published API yet. Until the P1 lift
> ships a real `src/index.js`, any release is a scaffolding / npm
> name-reservation placeholder — `require('mailproof')` does not resolve to a
> working module. See [`docs/02-design/DESIGN.md`](docs/02-design/DESIGN.md) for
> the phasing.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-22

First release published to npm — **reserves the `mailproof` name**. Pre-library:
there is still no working API (`main` resolves to `src/index.js`, which lands in
P1), so this publish is a documentation + POC scaffold, not a functional module.

### Changed
- **Renamed `gitcore` → `mailproof`.** The name reflects the identity: verification
  is grounded in DKIM/DMARC — i.e. email — by construction, so the channel is the
  trust anchor, not an implementation detail.

### Added
- `docs/` tier: `01-product/PRD.md` (with the §8 NO-GO table), `02-design/DESIGN.md`
  (moved into the design tier), `03-logs/decisions-log.md`, and `docs/README.md`
  (index + document precedence).
- npm publish workflow via OIDC trusted publishing (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`).
- Full publish metadata in `package.json` (repository, bugs, homepage, author,
  keywords, `files` allowlist, `publishConfig`); removed the `private` flag and the
  non-standard `_intendedDependencies` placeholder.
- This changelog.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Initial public scaffold (published as `gitcore`): a stdlib-only POC
  (`poc/pipeline.js`) proving the four pillars compose — verify → sequence →
  git ledger → email triggers — plus the original DESIGN doc and an Apache-2.0
  license. The POC is throwaway: it gets rewritten in P1 and is never shipped.
