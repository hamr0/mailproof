**Email-native multi-party coordination + a DKIM-backed digital notary. Git-native, offline-verifiable, 2 runtime deps.**

Email is already a verifiable identity layer: DKIM/DMARC let any receiver confirm a message was authorized by the sending domain — cold, with no prior relationship and no shared secret. mailproof treats email as a first-class citizen on top of that. It **arranges** multi-party replies, **records** each one to a per-event git repository, and **verifies** it (DKIM/DMARC/SPF/ARC) — so the commit chain *is* the proof: checkable with stock `git`, offline, forever, even if the service disappears. No app and no login for participants; they reply from their normal inbox.

## Two things it does

1. **Coordinate over email.** Ask named people to confirm something, in an order, and prove they did. Each reply is DKIM-verified, committed to a tamper-evident git ledger (every reply — even rejected ones — with a `counted` flag), and triggers the next email. Optionally Bitcoin-anchored via [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org).
2. **Digital notary.** Bind a verified signature to a hashed document. A **declaration** — one verified signer (a contract or a pink slip between two parties) — or an **attestation** — a threshold of distinct signers (a petition, a multi-witness statement). The document itself never leaves your server; only its `sha256` and the DKIM proof are committed.

## Quick start

```bash
npm i mailproof   # 2 runtime deps (mailauth, mailparser); Node ≥ 22.5
```

**1. Give your AI assistant the integration guide**

```
Read mailproof.context.md from node_modules/mailproof/mailproof.context.md
```

This single file is the complete wiring contract — every `create()` option, the API + `ingest()` result shape, the plus-tag address space, the `composeNotification` hook + 12 occasion kinds, the trust model, and the gotchas. It's structured for LLM consumption: your agent reads it once and knows how to wire the library correctly.

**2. Describe what you want**

```
I need to collect three sign-offs by email, in order, and end up with an
offline-verifiable proof each person really replied. Use mailproof. The
integration guide is in mailproof.context.md.
```

**Not sure what you need?** Paste this into any AI assistant:

```
I want to build an email-coordination or digital-notary flow with mailproof.
Read the integration guide at node_modules/mailproof/mailproof.context.md,
then ask me up to 5 questions about what I need. Based on my answers, tell me
which mode to use (workflow vs crypto sign-off) and show me the wiring code.
```

## What's inside

One `create()` binds four decoupled pillars over a single data dir; take the bound methods, or the lower-level named exports to compose your own pipeline.

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`create({ dataDir, domain, … })`** | Composition root — binds verify + sequence + git ledger + triggers over one dir |
| **`ingest(raw, envelope)`** | The inbound pipeline: prefilter → DKIM/DMARC verify → route → **commit (accept-with-flag)** → advance state → trigger the next email |
| **Trust classify** | `classifyTrust` grades each reply `verified` / `forwarded` / `authorized` / `unverified` from DKIM + DMARC + SPF + ARC |
| **Events (workflow)** | Ordered / parallel / custom steps among named participants; completion = all steps done |
| **Crypto sign-off** | **Declaration** (1 signer) or **attestation** (threshold of distinct signers), open or allow-listed, with an optional `requiredDocHash` |
| **Notary** | `hashDocument` / `verifyDocument` — bind a hashed document to a verified signature; plaintext addresses + bytes are never stored |
| **Git ledger** | A per-event git repo; `listCommits` is the tamper-evident chain — every reply committed, `counted` records whether it advanced state |
| **Offline verify** | `verify()` / `reverify()` re-check a commit against the **archived** DKIM key — holds even with live DNS down |
| **OTS anchoring** | Optional `otsBin` → `upgradeProofs()` folds a Bitcoin OpenTimestamps anchor into each commit's proof |
| **Triggers** | 12 neutral occasion `kind`s (activation, advance, completion, overdue, bounce, verify_report, …) over one `composeNotification` hook |
| **Lifecycle** | `activateEvent` · `editEvent` · `completeEvent` · `reopenEvent` · `sweep()` (overdue nudge + auto-archive) |

**Modes:** two generic ones — an **events** workflow and a **crypto sign-off** (declaration / attestation). Branding, web UI, auth, and the heavy attestation tail (revoke, multi-doc manifests, alternate dedup) are *consumer policy*, not kernel.

**Transport:** bundled self-hosted **Postfix/sendmail**, with opendkim signing outbound at the MTA — not a pluggable third-party mail provider.

**Deps:** 2 runtime — [`mailauth`](https://github.com/postalsys/mailauth) (DKIM/DMARC/ARC) + [`mailparser`](https://github.com/nodemailer/mailparser) (MIME), both required because verifying/parsing untrusted mail is security-critical. The git ledger shells out to the `git` binary (no `simple-git`); `ots` is an optional external binary. Pure ESM + JSDoc, no consumer build step; ships generated `strictNullChecks`-checked `.d.ts`.

This table is the map, not the manual — per-option wiring and API detail live in the **[Integration Guide](mailproof.context.md)** and [`docs/`](docs/).

## Recipes

### Coordinate three sign-offs in order

```js
import { create } from 'mailproof';

const core = create({ dataDir: './data', domain: 'app.example', sendmailBin: '/usr/sbin/sendmail' });

const id = 'onboarding42';      // your unique event id (alphanumeric)
await core.createEvent({
  id, type: 'workflow', flow: 'sequential', initiator: 'boss@app.example',
  steps: [
    { id: 'legal',   participant: 'alice@corp.example' },
    { id: 'finance', participant: 'bob@corp.example' },
  ],
});
await core.activateEvent(id);   // fires the kickoff email to the first eligible step

// Postfix pipes each inbound reply in (raw RFC-822 + the SMTP envelope):
const res = await core.ingest(rawEmail, { sender, recipient, clientIp, clientHelo });
// → { routed, mode, eventId, trustLevel, committedSeq, counted, eventComplete, notified }
```

### Notarize a contract (declaration — one verified signer + a hashed doc)

```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';

const doc = await fs.readFile('./contract.pdf');
const id = 'contract42';
await core.createEvent({
  id, type: 'crypto', initiator: 'boss@app.example',
  signers: ['counterparty@firm.example'],
  threshold: 1,                              // 1 = declaration
  requiredDocHash: core.hashDocument(doc),   // the counting reply must attach exactly this file
});
await core.activateEvent(id);
// counterparty replies with the file attached → DKIM-verified + hash-matched → committed + complete.
// Only the sha256 + DKIM proof are stored; the document stays on your server.
```

### Run a petition (attestation — N distinct verified signers, open to anyone)

```js
await core.createEvent({
  id: 'petition2026', type: 'crypto', initiator: 'org@app.example',
  open: true,        // any verified sender counts ("the link")
  threshold: 100,    // 100 distinct DKIM-verified signers to complete
});
```

### Verify a proof offline (no live DNS, no mailproof server)

```js
// Re-check a forwarded reply against its ARCHIVED key — works even if the signer rotated DNS:
const result = await core.verify(id, await fs.readFile('./forwarded.eml'));

// Or confirm a document matches what a verified signer committed:
const { found, matches } = await core.verifyDocument(id, doc, { email: 'counterparty@firm.example' });
```

---

## Grounded, not just claimed

- **Verification is tested against real-world mail.** The path reaches `verified` end to end on a genuine production opendkim-signed message over **live DNS**, a committed offline regression (`tests/integration/dkim-interop.test.js`) pins the interop deterministically, and deprecated **rsa-sha1** signatures are refused (RFC 8301). A manual harness (`tests/manual/verify-live.mjs`) drives the live path.
- **The surface is validated against a real consumer's full capability set.** P2 ran a throwaway probe consumer (public surface only; the origin app untouched) over the complete corner-case surface: **Bucket A 19/19 + Bucket C 7/7**. The kernel needed only the neutral `reopenEvent`/`completeEvent` lifecycle pair — every other capability (reference-doc manifests, two-step close, proof export, forwarding, redaction) rides the existing surface as consumer policy.
- **317 `node --test` tests pass** with 2 runtime deps; the public surface ships JSDoc-generated, `checkJs`-gated TypeScript declarations.

## Status

|---|---|
| P0 — composition proof (POC) | ✅ `npm run poc` |
| P1 — lift real modules + tests | ✅ COMPLETE — verify + inbound decoder, sequence routing, preprocessing, outbound, git-ledger storage, workflow + crypto engines, document notary, `create()`/`ingest()` assembly |
| m7c — verification surface | ✅ COMPLETE — durable DKIM-key archive, offline `verify()`/`reverify()`, OTS anchoring, public `verify+`/`reverify+` email endpoints |
| m7d — trigger pillar | ✅ COMPLETE — every kernel-derivable occasion as one of 12 neutral `kind`s over one `composeNotification` hook |
| P2 — surface validation | ✅ COMPLETE — via a throwaway probe consumer (public surface only). Bucket A 19/19 + Bucket C 7/7; only `reopenEvent`/`completeEvent` forced |

> **Pre-1.0:** the API can still change shape between `0.x` minors (SemVer 0.x).
